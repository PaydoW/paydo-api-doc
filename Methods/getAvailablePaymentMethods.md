## Required fields description

As you can see, the `config.fields` section of the response contains a description of the required fields. For direct payment ( payment without an intermediate checkout form) using this payment method, you must fill out all the required fields when [creating invoice](../Invoice/createInvoice.md). Otherwise, during the payment process, the payer will be redirected to the checkout form, where he/she will have to manually fill in the required fields.


---

Note: Please note the way in which the fields are filled in: fields `email`, `phone`, `name` are contained in the `payer` object, and all other necessary fields are contained in a nested `extraFields` object. Example:


```json
{
 "payer": {
   "email": "PAYER_EMAIL@EMAIL.COM",
   "phone": "PAYER_PHONE",
   "name": "PAYER_NAME",
   "extraFields": {
     "nationalid": "GB-123456798",
     "other": "SOME_DATA"
   }
 }
}
```
