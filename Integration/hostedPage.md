# Hosted page

This is quite simple type of integration.

It is suitable for those who do not have enough resources for development
and at the same time the control over almost the entire process will be on the side of Paydo.

### Minimal Checkout Flow

1. [Create Invoice](../Invoice/createInvoice.md)
1. [Redirect user to invoice preprocessing page](#redirect-user-to-invoice-preprocessing-page)
1. [Receive IPN (instant payment notification)](../Checkout/checkout.md#ipn) - in case of transaction was successfully created.

### Redirect user to invoice preprocessing page
